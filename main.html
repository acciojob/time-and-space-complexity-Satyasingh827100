	 <h1> Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the measurement of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete concerning its input
        size. An efficient algorithm aims for low time complexity, ensuring that it can handle larger inputs without
        significantly increasing the time taken to execute.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space Complexity is the measurement of the amount of memory space an algorithm uses concerning its input size.
        Algorithms with a space complexity of O(n) utilize memory linearly proportional to the input size.
        <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis is crucial in understanding how much memory an algorithm will require as the input
        scales.
